# Installation with Traefik

Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. It is designed to be simple to use and configure, and it integrates well with Docker.

AdventureLog has a built-in Traefik configuration that makes it easy to deploy and manage your AdventureLog instance.

The most recent version of the Traefik `docker-compose.yml` file can be found in the [AdventureLog GitHub repository](https://github.com/seanmorley15/AdventureLog/blob/main/docker-compose-traefik.yaml).
