Released 10-15-2024

Hi everyone! I am super excited to announce AdventureLog v0.7.0! This is one of the biggest updates I have ever released and I am super happy its finally ready for all of you to enjoy. The majority of this update is based around community feedback and ideas which is awesome!

# What's New

### Adventures 📍

- Adventures can now be visited multiple times by adding a new visit.
  - Existing adventure dates will be automatically migrated to this new format
- Adventures now use categories for organization.
- A new adventure creation/edit modal simplifies the process and has a cleaner overall design with dropdown menus.

### Collections 🍱

- **Collections can now be shared with other public users for collaboration!**
- Collections now have a link field so you can attach things like photo albums right to your collection.

### World Travel 🗺️

- The World Travel dataset now includes **every ISO defined country and region**. It is based off of a new dataset [dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database). Searching for countries is now supported. Capitals and world regions are now listed on the country card.

### Profiles 👥

- Users can now toggle their profile to be public. This allows other users to share collections with them for collaboration.

### Bug Fixes 🐛

### Other
